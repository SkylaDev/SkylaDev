### About me

Hai, I'm Skyla, a 22 year old trans girl who likes to play games and program random and rather... questionable things... :p

Here you can find some of my programming projects that I have made/work on.

### Some notable projects:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [YuriPyBot](https://yuri.skyla.moe/ "Yuri PyBot homepage") | A simple and free to use Discord bot that includes some fun mini-games, image generation and a range of other random features. |
| [3D craft](https://skyla.moe/projects/3dcraft "Project page for 3D Craft") | A Minecraft resource pack that makes the game more 3D with more realistic models that still follow the Minecraft style. |
| [Mumbo Clock](https://skyla.moe/projects/mumboclock "Project page for Mumbo Clock") | A Mumbo Jumbo themed desktop clock widget based off of [ElyBeatMaker's Outro Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7PPa8ZL5D4 "Mumbo Jumbo - Outro Time (elybeatmaker Remix)"). |
